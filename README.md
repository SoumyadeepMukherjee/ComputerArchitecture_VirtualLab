# ComputerArchitecture-VirtualLab

This GitHub repository explores the virtual lab work done in Computer Architecture using an online simulator EDA playground.

EDA Playground gives engineers immediate hands-on exposure to simulating and synthesizing SystemVerilog, Verilog, VHDL, C++/SystemC, and other HDLs. All you need is a web browser!
